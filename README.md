## 📖 About the Project
Ayo Arch is part of a tetralogy of tools supporting Marek's literary work. The project was born from the need to quickly browse visual materials related to the main character, **Ayo** (a Kenyan native), and documentation regarding the conspiracy of the **H.F.R.** (Human Factor Reduction) organization.
